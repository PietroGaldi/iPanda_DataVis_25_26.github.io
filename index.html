        This project aims to visualize different informations regarding energy use and production and how it affects the
        environment. There will be some focus on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the general state of our planet.
        To do this, we will use data from four different dataset:
      </p>
      <div class="list_img">
        <img src="imgs/logo.svg" alt="env_logo" class="env_logo">
        <ul>
          <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita</li>
          <li>Energy use per person</li>
          <li>Global primary energy consumption by source</li>
          <li>Electricity production by source</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        We're going to use the datasets from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/search">ourworldindata.org</a>, section Energy and Environment

     <h2>An overview of energy sources and emissions in recent years</h2>
     <p>
      This section provides an overview of the recent evolution of global and European energy systems between 2021 and 2024.<br> 
      It examines how total energy consumption has changed over time and how different sources like fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear, contribute to the global energy mix.<br>
      Particular attention is given to the main European countries, comparing their energy use per person and the composition of their electricity generation.<br>
      Finally, the section highlights the trend in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across Europe, showing how national energy choices have shaped their environmental impact in recent years.

  <div class="barplot" id="energy_22_24_chart"></div>
  <p>Global energy production remains dominated by fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal) each exceeding 40,000 TWh between 2022 and 2024.<br>
    It can be observed that the main sources of global energy are fossil fuels: gas, oil, and coal. 
    Each of these contributes more than 40,000 TWh, exceeding by more than four times the energy production of any other source.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <div class="barplot" id="energy_europe_grouped"></div>
  <p>Energy use per person varies widely across Europe.<br> 
     It is immediately evident that the highest consumption levels are found in Norway, 
     the northernmost and coldest country among those shown, where heating is likely to be used more extensively. <br>
     Applying the same reasoning, lower consumption levels can be observed in southern countries 
     such as Spain, Greece, and Italy, while higher values are recorded in northern countries 
     such as Sweden and the Netherlands. <br>
     The United Kingdom, on the other hand, exhibits one of the lowest consumption levels and 
     does not follow the general pattern observed for northern countries. <br>
     No clear trend can be identified looking at the variations across the three years, 
     as consumption increases in some countries while decreasing in others.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <div class="heatmap" id="co2_heatmap"></div>
  <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita are higher in Germany, 
    Norway, and the Netherlands, while those with the lowest emissions are Sweden, France 
    and Switzerland. <br>However, all the countries represented exhibit a declining trend over the 
    past three years.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <div class="barplot" id="eu_electricity_stacked"></div>
  <p>Electricity generation across Europe reveals striking contrasts in national energy strategies.<br>
    France and Germany record the highest levels of electricity production among the countries considered. In particular, France is strongly dominated by nuclear energy, 
    while Germany displays a more diversified energy mix, with significant contributions from coal, wind, and gas, as well as a substantial share of renewable sources.<br>
    Italy shows medium-to-high average production levels, largely reliant on gas and, to a lesser extent, on renewable sources, with an almost complete absence of nuclear power.<br>
    Nordic countries such as Norway and Sweden have a strong hydroelectric component; Norway, in particular, generates nearly all of its electricity from hydropower.<br>
    The United Kingdom and Spain exhibit a more balanced energy mix, with considerable shares of wind and gas.
    Countries with lower total production, such as Greece, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, still display diversified energy mix, although at significantly lower levels than France and Germany.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <div class="waffleplot" id="eu_coal_waffle"></div>
  <p>The share of fossil fuels in electricity generation differs sharply across Europe.<br>
    Each square represents a fraction of total electricity production, distinguishing fossil-based sources from all other sources.<br>
    This visualization highlights a marked heterogeneity in the usage of fossil fuel among European electricity systems.
    Countries without nuclear power and with limited hydropower resources are the most dependent on natural gas.
    By contrast, countries with abundant hydropower or strong nuclear capacity have almost eliminated fossil fuels from their electricity mix.<br><br>
    On the basis of these considerations, European countries can be classified into three main groups:
  </p>
  <ul class="waffle_ul">
    <li><b>Countries with electricity production still heavily reliant on fossil fuels:</b><br>
    Italy (56.9%), the Netherlands (50.7%), and Greece (52.3%) generate more than half of their electricity from gas, coal, or oil; natural gas is the dominant source, particularly in Italy and the Netherlands.</li>
    <li><b>Countries in transition, with a still significant fossil share:</b><br>
    Germany (46.0%), United Kingdom (38.8%), Spain (29.4%) have reduced coal use, but gas continues to play a major role.</li>
    <li><b>Countries that are almost fully decarbonised:</b><br>
    France (8.7%), Switzerland (2.5%), Sweden (1.5%), Norway (1.5%) show minimal dependence on fossil fuels and their
     electricity production is dominated by nuclear power (France, Switzerland) or hydropower (Norway, Sweden).</li>
  </ul>
