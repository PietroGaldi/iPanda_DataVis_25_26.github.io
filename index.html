    This project explores the intricate relationship between water pollution and air quality: two critical environmental issues that directly impact human 
    health, ecosystems, and climate stability. By analyzing global data, we aim to uncover how pollutants released into the atmosphere 
    can eventually contaminate water sources, and vice versa, creating a feedback loop that affects both natural and urban environments.

    We're going to use the "World's Air Quality and Water Pollution Dataset" from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorahaji/worlds-air-quality-and-water-pollution-dataset/data">Kaggle</a>
    The dataset contains informations about air quality and water pollution of cities (each with its region and country):
    </p>  
      <ul>
        <li>Air Quality values range from 0 (poor air quality) to 100 (excellent air quality).</li>
        <li>Water Pollution values range from 0 (no pollution) to 100 (extremely polluted).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Third part: Comparison of both water and air with subsequent analysis on their connection</p>
