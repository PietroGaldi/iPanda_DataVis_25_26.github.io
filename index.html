    Through Political Terror Scale dataset, this project aims to explore and visualize the levels of political violence
    and terror that a country experiences.
    There are 5 levels of PTS, ranging from 1 to 5.
    For each country there is an overview of how it's PTS level has changed over the years between 1976 and 2024.
