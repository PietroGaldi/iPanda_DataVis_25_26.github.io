          Through the Political Terror Scale dataset, this project aims to explore and visualize the levels of political violence
          and terror that a country experiences.
          There are 5 levels of PTS, ranging from 1 (high respect for human rights, little or no political violence) to 
          5 (widespread terror, systematic human rights violations), based on three different sources:

        <li>US State Department reports</li>

      <p>
        For each country, there is an overview of how its PTS level has changed over the years between 1976 and 2024.
        We're going to use the dataset from <a href="https://www.politicalterrorscale.org/Data/">politicalterrorscale.org</a>
