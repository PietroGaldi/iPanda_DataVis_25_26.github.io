        This project aims to visualize different informations regarding energy use and production and how it affects the
        environment. There will be some focus on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the general state of our planet.
        To do this, we will use data from four different dataset:
      </p>
      <div class="list_img">
        <img src="imgs/logo.svg" alt="env_logo" class="env_logo">
        <ul>
          <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita</li>
          <li>Energy use per person</li>
          <li>Global primary energy consumption by source</li>
          <li>Electricity production by source</li>

    <div>
      <h1>What happened in the last years?</h1>
      <h2>An overview of energy sources and emissions in recent years</h2>
      <p>
        This section provides an overview of the recent evolution of global and European energy systems between 2021 and
        2024.<br>
        It examines how total energy consumption has changed over time and how different sources like fossil fuels,
        renewables, and nuclear, contribute to the global energy mix.<br>
        Particular attention is given to the main European countries, comparing their energy use per person and the
        composition of their electricity generation.<br>
        Finally, the section highlights the trend in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across Europe, showing how national energy
        choices have shaped their environmental impact in recent years.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="barplot" id="energy_22_24_chart"></div>
    <p>Global energy production remains dominated by fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal) each exceeding 40,000 TWh between
      2022 and 2024.<br>
      It can be observed that the main sources of global energy are fossil fuels: gas, oil, and coal.
      Each of these contributes more than 40,000 TWh, exceeding by more than four times the energy production of any
      other source.
    </p>

    <div class="barplot" id="energy_europe_grouped"></div>
    <p>Energy use per person varies widely across Europe.<br>
      It is immediately evident that the highest consumption levels are found in Norway,
      the northernmost and coldest country among those shown, where heating is likely to be used more extensively. <br>
      Applying the same reasoning, lower consumption levels can be observed in southern countries
      such as Spain, Greece, and Italy, while higher values are recorded in northern countries
      such as Sweden and the Netherlands. <br>
      The United Kingdom, on the other hand, exhibits one of the lowest consumption levels and
      does not follow the general pattern observed for northern countries. <br>
      No clear trend can be identified looking at the variations across the three years,
      as consumption increases in some countries while decreasing in others.
    </p>

    <div class="heatmap" id="co2_heatmap"></div>
    <p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita are higher in Germany,
      Norway, and the Netherlands, while those with the lowest emissions are Sweden, France
      and Switzerland. <br>However, all the countries represented exhibit a declining trend over the
      past three years.
    </p>

    <div class="barplot" id="eu_electricity_stacked"></div>
    <p>Electricity generation across Europe reveals striking contrasts in national energy strategies.<br>
      France and Germany record the highest levels of electricity production among the countries considered. In
      particular, France is strongly dominated by nuclear energy,
      while Germany displays a more diversified energy mix, with significant contributions from coal, wind, and gas, as
      well as a substantial share of renewable sources.<br>
      Italy shows medium-to-high average production levels, largely reliant on gas and, to a lesser extent, on renewable
      sources, with an almost complete absence of nuclear power.<br>
      Nordic countries such as Norway and Sweden have a strong hydroelectric component; Norway, in particular, generates
      nearly all of its electricity from hydropower.<br>
      The United Kingdom and Spain exhibit a more balanced energy mix, with considerable shares of wind and gas.
      Countries with lower total production, such as Greece, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, still display diversified
      energy mix, although at significantly lower levels than France and Germany.
    </p>

    <div class="waffleplot" id="eu_coal_waffle"></div>
    <p>The share of fossil fuels in electricity generation differs sharply across Europe.<br>
      Each square represents a fraction of total electricity production, distinguishing fossil-based sources from all
      other sources.<br>
      This visualization highlights a marked heterogeneity in the usage of fossil fuel among European electricity
      systems.
      Countries without nuclear power and with limited hydropower resources are the most dependent on natural gas.
      By contrast, countries with abundant hydropower or strong nuclear capacity have almost eliminated fossil fuels
      from their electricity mix.<br><br>
      On the basis of these considerations, European countries can be classified into three main groups:
    </p>
    <ul class="waffle_ul">
      <li><b>Countries with electricity production still heavily reliant on fossil fuels:</b><br>
        Italy (56.9%), the Netherlands (50.7%), and Greece (52.3%) generate more than half of their electricity from
        gas, coal, or oil; natural gas is the dominant source, particularly in Italy and the Netherlands.</li>
      <li><b>Countries in transition, with a still significant fossil share:</b><br>
        Germany (46.0%), United Kingdom (38.8%), Spain (29.4%) have reduced coal use, but gas continues to play a major
        role.</li>
      <li><b>Countries that are almost fully decarbonised:</b><br>
        France (8.7%), Switzerland (2.5%), Sweden (1.5%), Norway (1.5%) show minimal dependence on fossil fuels and
        their
        electricity production is dominated by nuclear power (France, Switzerland) or hydropower (Norway, Sweden).</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Evolution of energy production & use in Europe over the last century <br> and its impact on CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions</h1>
      <h2>Insights drawn from a century of european energy and emission records</h2>
      <p>
        This section explores the long-term evolution of energy production and consumption in Europe over the past
        century, focusing on how these changes have influenced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Unlike the previous section,
        which examined recent trends, here we emphasize the distribution of energy and emission data over time,
        highlighting both structural shifts and national variations.<br>
        We analyze how electricity generation from renewable and non-renewable sources has evolved across selected
        European countries, revealing general growth in renewables alongside country-specific trajectories shaped by
        resource availability and policy frameworks.<br>
        Additionally, per capita energy consumption trends illustrate diverging patterns among countries, with some
        experiencing stabilization or decline in recent decades. Finally, the distribution of per capita CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions highlights persistent disparities across Europe, reflecting differences in energy strategies,
        industrial profiles, and policy effectiveness.<br>
        By examining these distributions, this section provides a deeper understanding of how long-term energy
        transitions have shaped both national energy systems and their environmental impact.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pyramid" id="pyramid_europe_5y"></div>
    <p>The evolution of renewable and non-renewable electricity generation across selected European countries between
      2000 and 2024 shows a general upward trend in renewables, though with national variations. <br>
      Norway and Sweden maintain consistently high renewable shares, while France shows limited change.<br>
      In contrast, Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom exhibit substantial growth in renewables, particularly
      after 2010. <br>
      The Netherlands and Greece record more recent but notable improvements, while Switzerland sustains a balanced mix
      throughout.<br>
      Overall, the data suggest a structural shift toward sustainable electricity production, tempered by distinct
      national trajectories shaped by resource availability and energy policy frameworks.
    </p>

    <div class="ridgeline" id="nch_se_percap_ridge"></div>
    <p>Per capita energy consumption trends (kWh/person) in Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway from the 1960s to the 2020s
      (averaged over each decade) reveal clear differences across countries. <br>
      Norway consistently reports the highest values, while Sweden demonstrates a steady increase until the 2000s
      followed by stabilization. <br>
      Switzerland shows lower overall consumption with moderate growth until the early 2000s and a recent decline. <br>
      Collectively, the data indicate divergent national consumption patterns yet a shared trend toward stabilization or
      reduction in energy use per capita over the past two decades.
    </p>

    <div class="boxplot" id="co2_boxplot"></div>
    <p>The distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita, averaged over each decade, among selected European
      countries since 2000 reveals marked cross-country variation in both median values and dispersion. <br>
      Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway exhibit the highest median emissions, whereas France, Sweden, and Switzerland
      maintain the lowest levels.<br>
      The United Kingdom shows a moderate but steadily declining emissions profile, while Southern European countries
      such as Italy, Spain, and Greece occupy intermediate positions but display wider variability.<br>
      Overall, the data show persistent but narrowing disparities in per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across Europe,
      shaped by national energy strategies, industrial composition, and policy effectiveness.
    </p>

    <div>
      <h1>Evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita over the last century</h1>
      <h2>A comparison among selected countries, with respect to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 2000</h2>
      <p>
        As seen in the last section, the five countries with the highest levels of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita
        since 2000 in Europe are
        <strong style="color:#4E79A7;">Germany</strong>,
        <strong style="color:#F28E2B;">United Kingdom</strong>,
        <strong style="color:#E15759;">Norway</strong>,
        <strong style="color:#76B7B2;">Netherlands</strong>,
        and <strong style="color:#59A14F;">Greece</strong>.<br>
        This section offers a deeper look at the long-term evolution of these five countries, starting from 1900 up to
        2024.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="areachart" id="co2_area_chart"></div>
    <p>The United Kingdom enters the 20<sup>th</sup> century with high emissions, reflecting its early industrial
      development.
      Germany and the Netherlands show steady growth through the first half of the century, with a marked dip in the
      early 1940s tied
      to widespread reductions in industrial and energy activity.<br>
      From the 1950s to the 1970s, all five countries experience substantial increases in per-capita emissions,
      mirroring broader trends in energy consumption, industrial expansion, and technological progress.
      Germany and the Netherlands register the sharpest rises, whereas Norway follows a more moderate but consistently
      upward path.<br>
      Most countries reach their peak levels between the late 1970s and early 1990s. After this period, emissions
      decline
      across the group, reflecting improvements in energy efficiency, gradual modernization of energy systems,
      and long-term shifts in economic structure.<br>
      Greece, which starts the century at very low emission levels, shows a steady climb throughout the latter half of
      the
      20<sup>th</sup> century, peaking in the early 2000s before entering a downward trend.<br>
      Together, these extended historical trajectories offer a deeper view of how national development, industrial
      change,
      and evolving energy strategies have shaped per-capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over more than a century.

      <h1>Geographic insights into emissions, energy use and production</h1>
      <h2>How was our world in 2020?</h2>
      <p>This section examines the global distribution of energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        in the year 2020, focusing on how spatial patterns reveal broad geographic disparities.<br>
        By comparing per capita energy consumption across countries, clear contrasts emerge: higher levels
        in northern and industrialized regions versus lower values in milder or less energy-intensive areas.<br>
        Similarly, the global distribution of per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions exposes marked differences among world
        regions, with certain
        fossil fuel dependent economies displaying substantially elevated emission levels.<br>
        Finally, a spatial bubble representation of key energy indicators provides additional insight into the relative
        magnitude of national contributions, helping contextualize the role each country plays within the global
        landscape.<br>
        Taken together, these spatial distributions offer a snapshot of worldwide energy and emission patterns in 2020,
        shedding light on the structural, climatic, and economic factors underlying global variability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="choropleth" id="choropleth_map"></div>
    <p>The map shows a clear north-south gradient in 2020 energy consumption per capita. <br>
      Iceland records the highest values in Europe, with the other Nordic countries also displaying very high
      consumption. <br>
      Central and Eastern Europe present more varied patterns, while Russia stands out with consistently high levels
      linked to its cold climate. <br>
      Southern Europe shows much lower consumption overall, largely due to milder
      temperatures and reduced heating needs.</p>


    <div class="map_title">Global CO2 emissions per capita (2020)</div>

    </div>
    <p>The 3D map illustrates the annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per country, expressed in tons per capita.<br>
      By observing the globe closely, it's possible to notice that the European regions exhibit slightly higher average
      emissions
      than Africa while remaining, on average, lower than those of Asia.<br>
      The visualization clearly highlights the much more high emissions of several Arab states, particularly
      Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.<br>
      Other countries that appear to have higher per capita CO<sub>2</sub> emissions include Australia, New Caledonia,
      USA
      and Canada.</p>

    <div class="bubble" id="bubble_map"></div>
    <p>The map illustrates the absolute total volume of electricity generated from clean sources (hydro, wind, solar,
      bioenergy, and nuclear) across European countries in 2020.
      The size of each bubble reflects the total terawatt-hours (TWh) produced from these sources.<br>
      The largest volumes of clean electricity are generated by the major economies: France exhibits the largest bubble,
      mainly driven by its significant nuclear power output.<br>
      Other countries with high totals include Germany, Sweden, and Russia, which rely heavily on combinations of hydro,
      wind, and nuclear capacity.
      In contrast, most smaller nations, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe, display smaller bubbles,
      indicating lower absolute clean electricity production volumes in 2020.</p>

    <div>
      <h1>Dynamics of energy composition and connectivity between countries</h1>
      <h2>How has the European energy landscape evolved?</h2>
      <p>This section investigates the structural evolution of European energy systems, focusing on the
        interplay between domestic generation portfolios and cross-border trade networks.<br>
        By analyzing electricity production across key nations, distinct national strategies emerge: from the
        nuclear dominance or hydroelectric reliance of specific countries to the gradual diversification into
        renewables over recent decades.<br>
        Complementing this production view, the visualization of oil export flows reveals the spatial connectivity of
        the region, highlighting central distribution hubs and the directional nature of resource exchange.<br>
        Taken together, these visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the continent's energy metabolism,
        illustrating the complex relationship between how energy is generated locally and how it flows across borders.

    <p>The flow of electricity production across a selection of ten European countries and its distribution by primary
      energy source can be examined across a range of years between 1985 and 2024.<br>
      The volume of electricity generated, measured in Terawatt-hours (TWh), is represented by the thickness of the
      flow.<br>
      The analysis revolves around 10 nations: <strong>Italy, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway,
        Netherlands, Greece, and
        Switzerland</strong>.<br>
      In a representative year,such as 2020, Germany exhibits the largest total production volume (approximately 567
      TWh). Its energy portfolio
      is notably diverse, relying heavily on a substantial volume of electricity from both Coal and Wind, followed by
      Gas.<br>
      In contrast, France's large production volume is overwhelmingly dominated by its significant Nuclear power output.
      Meanwhile, Norway stands out for its near-total reliance on Hydro power, showcasing a highly clean energy profile.
      Countries like Greece typically reflect the lower end of the absolute electricity output within this group.<br>
      It's also important to notice that <strong>until 1990</strong>, electricity sources were just <strong>nuclear,
        coal, hydro, oil and gas</strong>;
      other sources like bioenergy, solar, wind and other renewables were introduced only in more recent years.</p>

    <p>The network of oil export flows across European countries is visualized here for the year 2015.<br>
      The economic value of these transfers, measured in US Dollars ($), is represented by the thickness of the flow
      arrows, which clearly indicate the direction of trade from source to destination.<br>
      The analysis revolves around the top exporters in the region: <strong>Hungary, Romania, Italy, Belarus, Germany,
        Croatia, Slovakia, Austria, Malta, and the Netherlands</strong>.<br>
      Hungary exhibits the largest total export volume (approximately $181 million).
      As illustrated by the highlighted view, it acts as a primary distribution hub, with thick
      flow lines radiating outwards to supply neighboring markets.<br>
      In contrast, Romania follows with a significantly lower volume ($67 million), while major
      economies like Germany ($29 million) and Italy ($34 million) show more moderate
      export figures in this specific dataset.<br>
      Meanwhile, smaller players like Malta and the Netherlands sit at the lower end of this top-ten selection.<br>
      It's also important to notice the structural nature of the network; while the leader commands a massive share of
      the visible flow, the density and volume of exports drop off sharply for the remaining nations.</p>
